Create a full-stack SaaS web app called **PromptOps**.

🌐 General Requirements:
- Stack: Node.js with Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and Tailwind CSS for frontend styling.
- Use EJS (or React if easier) for templating.

🎨 Design & UI:
- Modern, clean UI
- Color scheme: Dark gray background with green/light green accents
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Add footer: “⚡ Powered by Monzed” centered at bottom of each page

🔐 Auth:
- User authentication (email + password) with session management
- Use JWT or secure cookies

📊 Dashboard:
- After login, user lands on Control Dashboard
- Show number of prompts used, history of runs, plan info, and quick test prompt area
- Admin page (for internal use) to manage users/plans (can be basic)

💡 Core Features:
- Allow users to:
  - Create and save prompts
  - See history of prompt runs
  - Edit prompt versions
  - Test prompt with AI (GPT or Gemini)
- Free plan: Max 5 saved prompts
- Paid plans:
  - **Pro Plan**: $19/month – 100 prompts
  - **Team Plan**: $49/month – Unlimited prompts + team access

🤖 AI Integration:
- Use **ChatGPT (GPT-4o)** or **Gemini Pro** — whichever is more reliable and free or low cost at scale

💼 Extras:
- Add seed user + seed prompts for demo
- Show usage stats on dashboard (e.g. prompts used/left)

- Make entire codebase clean and modular

Final product should be fully functional SaaS app that’s easy to extend.
